## Youtube comment section clone build with React js

The YouTube comment section is a dynamic and interactive platform for users to express their thoughts and opinions. I build this project using React js where the user have the ability to add a new comment by entering their text and submitting it. The comments can also be deleted by the user if they choose to do so. Additionally, users can like or dislike a comment by clicking on the corresponding buttons.

## what really fun about his project?

The comment section also includes a unique feature where, upon adding a new comment, a random person from a data array is selected and their initials are used as the profile image. To enhance the visual appeal a random color background color is also assigned to the profile image.

### Main goal about this project

this project provides a great opportunity for me developer to learn and apply various concepts related to React, user interaction, and data management, making it a fun and educational experience
